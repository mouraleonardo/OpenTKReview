This repository provides a barebones setup that opens an 800x600 window with a black background, ready for students to extend with OpenGL rendering tasks, such as drawing shapes, gradients, or 3D scenes. Ideal for beginners exploring graphics APIs, it serves as a foundation for exercises in interactive 3D applications.
